Assignment for FI3201 Computational Physics Class 01 Semester 2 Year 2021/2022

## fork repository
1. Fork this repository to your reposity and edit it there using ![](images/github-fork-button.png) button. \
  Then you will get a fork of this repository under your github acccount, e.g. \
  ![](images/forked-repository.png)
2. Once the source is updated ([dudung/fi3201-01-2021-2](https://github.com/dudung/fi3201-01-2021-2)) it will appear that your repository (this branch) `n` commits behind main as follows \
  ![](images/branch-is-behind-main.png)
3. Resolve this or update your local copy using the ![](images/fetch-upstream-button.png) button and choose ![](images/fetch-and-merge-button.png), then you will get \
  ![](images/branch-is-up-to-date-with-main.png)
4. Do not use ![](images/contribute-button.png). This will be used only once at the end of semester for merging all changes in your local reposity to the main. You will be notified when to do this.

## work with the assignments
1. Navigate to [assignments folder](assignments).
2. Choose assigment to work with, e.g [02](assignments/02) \
  ![](images/choosing-assignment.png)
3. Navigate to the folder \
  ![](images/assigment-instruction.png) \
  and read the instruction.
4. Make a folder with your NIM, copy the `README.md` containing the instruction, and edit it with your answer. \
  ![](images/assigment-answer.png)
5. After that you will have notification that this branch (your local repository) is `n` commits a head of main ([dudung/fi3201-01-2021-2](https://github.com/dudung/fi3201-01-2021-2)) \
  ![](images/branch-is-ahead-of-main.png) \
  and it is ok and do nothing about it.

## fecth upstream
1. After work on an assignment, main might be modified for the next assignement and branch will be ahead (because you do the assigment: 1 commit) and behind (because main release new assignment: 3 commits) \
  ![](images/branch-is-ahead-behind-main.png)
2. Resolve this or update your local copy using the ![](images/fetch-upstream-button.png) button and choose ![](images/fetch-and-merge-button.png), then you will get \
  ![](images/branch-is-ahead-of-main.png) \
the ahead state due your work only.
